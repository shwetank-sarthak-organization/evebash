# EveBash Railway Backend

Standalone Express service for EveBash API, worker orchestration, and privileged
admin operations. The web frontend remains on Vercel and calls this service via
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`. Mobile uses `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, and the analytics
dashboard uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

## Routes

- `GET /health`
- `POST /api/contact-messages`
- `GET /api/pricing-plans`
- `/api/media/*` for upload, multipart upload, save, delete, rotate, thumbnails,
  indexing status, and Modal/QStash triggers
- `POST /api/find-you` and `POST /api/find-you/index-face`
- `POST /api/subscription/apply-pending`
- `POST /api/subscription/apply-due`
- `POST /api/admin/control`
- `GET /api/admin/supabase-billing`
- `GET /api/admin/cloudflare-billing`
- `GET /api/admin/backblaze-usage`
- `GET /api/admin/railway-billing`

The subscription payment creation and verification routes remain in Next.js
during this incremental migration. Move them only with a separate Razorpay
webhook and payment verification cutover.

## Local dev

```sh
npm install --prefix apps/backend
npm --prefix apps/backend run dev
```

## Railway

Use `apps/backend` as the Railway service root. Set the start command to:

```sh
npm start
```

Set `API_BASE_URL` to the public Railway API URL, for example
`https://api-staging.evebash.com`. This makes delayed QStash jobs call Railway
instead of the frontend deployment.

Copy the variables in `.env.example` into the Railway service. Keep service-role,
management, storage, Cloudflare, Railway, QStash, Modal, and cron credentials on
Railway only. Do not expose those values through `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_*`,
or `VITE_*` names.

Set a long random `INTERNAL_JOB_SECRET` in Railway. QStash thumbnail and delayed
indexing callbacks forward this value as a bearer token. Keep the same value in
any temporary Vercel fallback environment until those handlers are retired.

## Scheduled plan processing

The backend applies due plan changes itself every hour (and a minute after startup), using the Indian calendar
date: `src/services/planChangeScheduler.ts`. Set `PLAN_CHANGE_SCHEDULER=false` to turn that off. The same work
can also be triggered by hand:

```text
POST /api/subscription/apply-due
Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>
```

# Automatic media watchdog

`MEDIA_WATCHDOG_ENABLED=false` disables the startup and periodic media recovery/cleanup runs.
When absent or set to `true`, existing behavior is preserved: one run after 30 seconds,
then every 10 minutes. Normal uploads and processing are unaffected. The authenticated
manual `/api/media/watchdog/run` endpoint remains available; disable any external schedules
calling it separately if this service must not perform recovery/cleanup.

While staging and production share Supabase/B2, leave staging enabled and set this variable
to `false` in production after deploying code that supports it. This does not isolate data
or stop ordinary requests from modifying shared resources.

## Email signup checks

`POST /api/v1/signup/check-email` accepts `{ "email": "user@example.com" }` and
returns only `{ "exists": boolean }`. It checks the paginated Supabase Auth
directory, including Google-only and unconfirmed accounts, rather than `profiles`.
The service-role key remains on the backend. Lookup failures return 503 and the
web signup stops instead of claiming a confirmation email was sent.

Deploy the backend endpoint before the frontend that calls it. No migration or
new credentials are required. Google OAuth continues using its existing flow.
The public existence response intentionally reveals account registration status.
A conservative, in-memory budget of 60 checks per 15 minutes per backend process
limits directory scans regardless of proxy headers. At larger user/traffic volumes,
replace scans with a restricted indexed Auth lookup and use a shared rate-limit store.
